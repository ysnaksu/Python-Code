Customer Behavior & Sales Decision Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on sales performance and customer behavior analysis using transactional, demographic, product, and promotion data.
The goal is to provide decision-makers with clear insights into where revenue is generated, which customer segments are most valuable, and how sales channels, loyalty programs, and churn impact business outcomes.

Rather than simple descriptive statistics, the project emphasizes comparative analysis and visual decision support using business-focused charts.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes customer demographics, transaction history, product attributes, promotions, and behavioral metrics such as:

Customer profile (age, gender, income bracket, loyalty program, churn)

Sales metrics (total sales, average purchase value, transactions)

Channel behavior (online vs in-store purchases)

Product and category performance

Seasonal, weekend, and geographic indicators

The dataset structure enables multi-dimensional analysis across customers, products, time, and channels.

Key Business Questions Answered

This project answers practical questions commonly asked by sales leaders, marketing teams, and executives:

Which loyalty programs generate the highest total sales?

Which income segments have the highest average purchase value?

Is online or in-store purchasing more dominant?

How much revenue is lost due to customer churn?

Which product categories perform best?

How do seasonality and weekends affect sales?

Which cities or regions contribute the most to revenue?

Analysis Approach

The analysis is built using:

Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation

Matplotlib for decision-oriented visualizations

Grouped comparisons instead of raw summaries

Business-focused KPIs instead of technical metrics

Each analysis step compares segments vs segments to support real-world decision making.

Visualizations Included

The project generates the following decision-maker friendly charts:

Bar Charts

Total Sales by Loyalty Program

Average Purchase Value by Income Bracket

Average Sales: Churned vs Non-Churned Customers

Product Category Performance

Top Cities by Total Sales

Pie Chart

Online vs In-Store Purchase Distribution

These visuals are designed to be presentation-ready and easily interpretable by non-technical stakeholders.
